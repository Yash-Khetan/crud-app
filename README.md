   ## What did I learn while building this project ?
   I learnt how to build a functional crud app which basically creates, reads, updates and delete a set of data or a parameter. While building this project I explored how to work with a <b>JSON File</b> which also helped me use the concepts of file I/O in python.

   ## Aim for the enhanceemnt of this project.
   1. Add an AI summarizer which would basically summarize a particular long note.
   2. Add timestamps based on the creation and updation of the note
